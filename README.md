# Flans-Mod-Plus-Plus
Flan's Mod ++ is a fork of Flan's Mod Plus for 1.7.10, with new features- most of which are easily configurable.


Feature List
------------
New Vehicle Mechanics.
* Vehicles decelerate automatically when W or S aren't being held.
* Enable Cruise Control using the Mode Switch key to keep your vehicle's throttle steady.
* Vehicles can drift/slide when turning; vehicles with lower Traction will drift more.
* Acceleration/Deceleration rates and Traction can be configured in the vehicle config .txt files.





Flan's Mod ++ compared to Flan's Mod Ultimate: Stability Edition
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flan's Mod ++ was built off a version of FM+ prior to the Ultimate update.  As such, it is closer to Flan's Mod 4.10 than it is to FMU:SE.  Some features present in Ultimate are also in FM++, but are implemented in a different way.

Compatibility with Flan's Mod 4.10
----------------------------------
FM++ was designed with compatability in mind.  All models and config txt files from normal Flan's packs should be compatable with FM++.  Servers can switch from normal Flan's Mod to FM++ with few, if any, changes required.
