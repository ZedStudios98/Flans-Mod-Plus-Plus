	FLAN'S MOD ++
	CHANGELOG


[Version 1.0.2]
* Separated firemode indicator from the ammo counter- it is now rendered independently.
* Added controls for whether to show a gun's crosshair in various situations, such as when a scope is attached or when aiming.

* HITBOX FIX: Ported GoldSloth's vehicle part hitbox fix from Flan's Mod Ultimate: Stability Edition.
* Increased how much vehicles slide/drift while turning at high throttle levels; added config values to control this behavior.
* Added the ability to use the landing gear key to reset the yaw of the driver's camera in vehicles.
	- Holding this key locks the camera until the key is released.
* Boats can no longer be driven when out of water; amphibious vehicles still can be driven both on land and in water.
* Boats will no longer apply pitch or roll.
* Added work-in-progress code for Submarines. NOTE: Submarine code is janky and may be subject to change.
	- "IsSubmarine True" activates Submarine behavior.
	- Use SurfaceRate, SubmergeRate, and MaxSurfaceLevel to control Sub behavior.
	- Further improvements and documentation coming in a later update.

* Fixed broken heading readout on the HUD for vehicles and planes.


[Version 1.0.1]
* Fixed hover mode emitters firing when in flight mode.
* Updated HUD for planes/helicopters to add Pitch and Roll lines.
* Added auto-leveling for aircraft; in flight, roll (and pitch for helicopters) will settle to 0 when nearly level.
	- This makes leveling roll in-flight and hovering in helicopters/VTOL planes easier.


[Version 1.0.0]
Initial Release.

* Added bipod mechanics for grip attachments.
* Improved vehicle mechanics, including drifting, engines that can only take certain fuels, a Cruise Control mode, etc. 
* Vehicles will now throttle up/down faster, and throttle will naturally decay to simulate friction.
* Improved plane mechanics, including increased speed when diving, configurable lift ratings, etc.
* Planes no longer come to a hard, sudden stop when out of fuel, instead uncontrollably throttling down.
