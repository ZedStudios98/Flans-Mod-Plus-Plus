	FLAN'S MOD ++
	CHANGELOG


[Version 1.0.1]
* Fixed hover mode emitters firing when in flight mode.
* Updated HUD for planes/helicopters to add Pitch and Roll lines.
* Added auto-leveling for aircraft; in flight, roll (and pitch for helicopters) will settle to 0 when nearly level.
	- This makes leveling roll in-flight and hovering in helicopters/VTOL planes easier.


[Version 1.0.0]
Initial Release.

* Added bipod mechanics for grip attachments.
* Improved vehicle mechanics, including drifting, engines that can only take certain fuels, a Cruise Control mode, etc.

* Improved plane mechanics, including increased speed when diving, configurable lift ratings, etc.
* Planes no longer come to a hard, sudden stop when out of fuel, instead uncontrollably throttling down.
